# Computer Vision - Image Classification tutorial

The image source used for this tutorial is a subset of the voc dataset. It comprises three categories: `automobile`, `plane`and `train`. There is an equal number (80) of instances per category.
Although the aim of the notebook is building a classification pipeline to reliably classify images of these three categories, its layout is rather sequential. This is an intentional choice, in order to facilitate the illustration of several processing steps. The code architecture would be leaner and significantly more compact if the purpose of the notebook were solely deployment/application.
